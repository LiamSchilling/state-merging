"""Push output operations for finite-state transducers.

This module provides functions to normalize output distributions in FSTs by
pushing outputs forward or backward through states. These operations redistribute
output values while preserving the transduction semantics.

Type Parameters:
    Q: State type
    U: Input symbol type
    V: Output value type
    T: Result of LCP type
