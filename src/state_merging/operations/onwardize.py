"""Onwardization of finite state transducers.

This module implements the onwardization algorithm, which transforms subsequential
finite state transducers (SFSTs) into a canonical form by pushing outputs forward
through the state machine.

Type Parameters:
    Q: State type
    U: Input symbol type
    V: Output value type
    T: Result of LCP type

    This function modifies the SFST in-place by computing a common prefix of local outputs
    at each state and pushing that prefix forward to transitions entering the state.
    The states must be processed in a reverse topological order.

    Args:
        fst: The trim, acyclic SFST to onwardize (modified in-place).
        mul: Binary multiplication operation for outputs (e.g., concatenation).
             Combines prefix with existing output: mul(prefix, output).
        ldiv: Binary left division operation for outputs (e.g., string difference).
              Removes prefix from output: ldiv(prefix, output).
        lcp: Function to compute the longest common prefix from a set of outputs.
             Returns the longest prefix common to all outputs in the set.
