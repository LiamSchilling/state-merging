"""Subsequential Finite State Transducer implementation.

This module provides a generic framework for subsequential finite state transducers,
which are automata that transform input sequences into output sequences by
transitioning through states and accumulating outputs along transitions.

Type Parameters:
    Q: State type
    U: Input symbol type
    V: Output value type
    A: Accumulator type

    """A Subsequential Finite State Transducer.

    An SFST is a state machine that produces outputs as it transitions through
    states based on input symbols. It supports initial outputs, transition-based outputs,
    and final state-based outputs. Partiality is also supported.

    Type Parameters:
        Q: State type.
        U: Input symbol type.
        V: Output value type.

    Attributes:
        state_set: Set of all possible states in the automaton.
        input_set: Set of all possible input symbols.
        initial_state: The starting state for execution.
        transitions: Mapping from (state, input) pairs to (next_state, output) tuples.
        initial_output: Output produced before processing the first input.
        final_outputs: Mapping from final states to output values.

    Invariants:
        - All states refered to in the machine are elements of `state_set`.
        - All inputs refered to in the machine are elements of `input_set`.

    Example:
        >>> # Create a simple transducer
        >>> # Type parameters: Q=int, U=str, V=int
        >>> fst = SFST(
        ...     state_set={0, 1, 2},
